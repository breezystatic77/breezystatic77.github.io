# Prefixes

When you create a character, you will be asked to supply a **Prefix.**, which is any number of characters on either side of the word **`TEXT`**. Example prefixes:

`!TEXT`

`_TEXT`

`aragorn:TEXT`

`{{TEXT}}`

`?TEXT`

`TEXT===`

Whenever you send a message that has one of your characters' prefixes in it, along with some regular text, Thespian will replace that message with one from your character.

Think of it like a custom, personal command for posting as your character.

## Example:

You create a character named Tyler, and you make the prefix `a>`, for _alpha_, because it's a phrase features heavily in Tyler's lore. It's good to make your prefixes memorable.

You create Tyler with this command:

```
th!create Tyler a>TEXT
```

To post as Tyler, send a message that looks like this:

```
a>My name is Tyler. I'm a professional protein powder salesman and machine gun impersonator.
```

Thespian will see your post has Tyler's prefix in it, and will reformat it.

> _My name is Tyler. I'm a professional protein powder salesman and machine gun impersonator._

Once you know your prefixes, you'll be able to post as any one of your characters as quick as you can remember them.

?>You can put parts of your prefix before your message, after your message, or both.<br/> Yes, this does mean that your prefix can technically be a suffix, but life is too short to worry about such things.
