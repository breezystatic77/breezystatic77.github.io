# FAQ

## What does this bot do?

Thespian adds immersion to your roleplay by allowing you to replace your avatar and username with the avatar and username of a character you create. Check out the demo on the [Homepage](http://thespian.actor/#how-it-works)

## How does it do that?

See [How it Works](how-it-works.md) for more information.

## How do I make a character?

See the help page for the [`create`](commands.md#create) for more information.

## I can't get the posting to work.

This is often a problem with permissions for the bot. It needs the following to properly create a post:

- View messages
- Manage messages
- Manage webhooks

If it's not working, try kicking the bot and re-inviting it. If that doesn't work, double-check to make sure it's not being affected by any server roles.

Additionally, extremely new servers (less than 1 day) _may_ have some restriction on bots creating webhooks with them. If you just created your server, try waiting a day.

If none of the above work, please report your problem in the official Discord! I keep track of bug reports, and I'm always trying to make the bot as stable as possible.
