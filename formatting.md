# Formatting

When editing a profile that's in Markdown mode, all normal [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) can be used, along with some additions.

## Alignment

You can align a block of text to the right:

```
->This text is aligned right->
```

Or to the left:

```
<-This text is aligned left<-
```

Or to the center:

```
->This text is aligned center<-
```

## Subscript / Superscript

You can make subscript text:

```
~This text is subscript~
```

Or superscript:

```
^This text is superscript^
```
