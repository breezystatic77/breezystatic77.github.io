# Formatting

When editing a profile in Markdown mode, all normal [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) can be used.

Previously, there were some additional pieces of custom syntax that are no longer supported. You can use some very simple HTML tags in their place.

## Alignment

You can align a block of text to the center:

```md
<center>This text is aligned center</center>
```

Or to the right:

```md
<p style="text-align: right;">This text is aligned right</p>
```

## Subscript / Superscript

You can make subscript text:

```md
This text is <sub>subscript</sub>
```

Or superscript:

```md
This text is <sup>superscript</sup>
```
